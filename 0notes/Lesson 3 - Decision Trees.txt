L3.8 has code to show our decision tree (useful reference)
L3.12 Quiz also has code useful for future reference

Decision tree will maximize information gain where:
  information gain = entropy(parent) - [weighted avg]*entropy(children)


Useful other references:
  import math
  entropy = Pi*math.log(Pi,2)


If you're scipy-literate, you can also turn a calculation like this into a two-liner: 
  import scipy.stats
  print scipy.stats.entropy([2,1],base=2)
