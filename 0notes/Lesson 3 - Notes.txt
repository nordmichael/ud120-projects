SVM  = support vector machine
Margin is distance between line and nearest point between classes,
  Maximizing margin can help to find best fit line
  Syntax is more or less the same as any of the other methods we used for naive_bayes

Need methods fit(features,labels) and predict(features) [returns labels]

We can add features to make a dataset linearly seperable (E.g quadratic or polar coordinates)
  See kernel functions http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#kernel-functions
